## FastSend Technical Information

FastSend has been integrated into the Core Daemon in two ways:
* "push" notifications (ZMQ and `-fastsendnotify` cmd-line/config option);
* RPC commands.

#### ZMQ

When a "Transaction Lock" occurs the hash of the related transaction is broadcasted through ZMQ using both the `zmqpubrawtxlock` and `zmqpubhashtxlock` channels.

* `zmqpubrawtxlock`: publishes the raw transaction when locked via FastSend
* `zmqpubhashtxlock`: publishes the transaction hash when locked via FastSend

This mechanism has been integrated into Bitcore-Node-MarteX which allows for notification to be broadcast through Insight API in one of two ways:
* WebSocket: [https://github.com/martexcoin/insight-api-martex#web-socket-api](https://github.com/martexcoin/insight-api-martex#web-socket-api)
* API: [https://github.com/martexcoin/insight-api-martex#fastsend-transactions](https://github.com/martexcoin/insight-api-martex#fastsend-transactions)

#### Command line option

When a wallet FastSend transaction is successfully locked a shell command provided in this option is executed (`%s` in `<cmd>` is replmartex by TxID):

```
-fastsendnotify=<cmd>
```

#### RPC

Details pertaining to an observed "Transaction Lock" can also be retrieved through RPC, itâ€™s important however to understand the underlying mechanism.

By default, the MarteX Core daemon will launch using the following constant:

```
static const int DEFAULT_FASTSEND_DEPTH = 5;
```

This value can be overridden by passing the following argument to the MarteX Core daemon:

```
-fastsenddepth=<n>
```

The key thing to understand is that this value indicates the number of "confirmations" a successful Transaction Lock represents. When Wallet RPC commands which support `minconf` and `addlockconf` parameters (such as `listreceivedbyaddress`) are performed and `addlockconf` is `true`, then `fastsenddepth` attribute is taken into account when returning information about the transaction. In this case the value in `confirmations` field you see through RPC is showing the number of `"Blockchain Confirmations" + "FastSend Depth"` (assuming the funds were sent via FastSend).

There is also a field named `instantlock` (that is present in commands such as `listsinceblock`). The value in this field indicates whether a given transaction is locked via FastSend.

**Examples**

1. `listreceivedbyaddress 0 true`
   * FastSend transaction just occurred:
        * confirmations: 5
   * FastSend transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
        * confirmations: 6
   * non-FastSend transaction just occurred:
        * confirmations: 0
   * non-FastSend transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
        * confirmations: 1

2. `listreceivedbyaddress 0`
   * FastSend transaction just occurred:
        * confirmations: 0
   * FastSend transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
        * confirmations: 1
   * non-FastSend transaction just occurred:
        * confirmations: 0
   * non-FastSend transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
        * confirmations: 1

3. `listsinceblock`
    * FastSend transaction just occurred:
        * confirmations: 0
        * instantlock: true
    * FastSend transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
        * confirmations: 1
        * instantlock: true
    * non-FastSend transaction just occurred:
        * confirmations: 0
        * instantlock: false
    * non-FastSend transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
        * confirmations: 1
        * instantlock: false
